## About
We use Ace, an online code editor from Ajax Org so its super easy to make edit bodys.
We have tried to make it as easy as possible to add it with out version of Solarized to your site.
The easiest way we came up with was was using the iframe and a URL.

```html
<iframe src="https://purecodeeditor.github.io/embed" style="margin:none" width="100%" height="100%"></iframe>
```
