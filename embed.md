## About
We use Ace, an online code editor from Ajax Org so its super easy to make edit bodys.
We have tried to make it as easy as possible to add it with out version of Solarized to your site.
The easiest way we came up with was was using the iframe and a URL.

```html
<iframe src="https://purecodeeditor.github.io/embed" style="margin:none" width="100%" height="95%"></iframe>
```
[Demo Here](https://purecodeeditor.github.io/embed)
If you check out the demo you will notice that its only a text editor, but thats ok.
We also added a very convenient way to change the language in the iframe in the URL.
Just add a `?LNAGUAGE` to the end of the URL. E.g. https://purecodeeditor.github.io/embed?javascript. 
Its not case sensitive, phew.
